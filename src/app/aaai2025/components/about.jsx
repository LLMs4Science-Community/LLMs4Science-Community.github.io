        <p>
          Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language
          understanding and computer vision. In particular, research on LLMs and
          multi-modal LLMs in these two domains is progressing rapidly, and this
          progress is starting to permeate a broad range of scientific
          disciplines. In this second offering of our workshop, our focus is on
          FMs for advancing biological discoveries. Current efforts have
          revealed that indeed FMs are advancing our ability to conduct
          biological research in silico, formulate interesting hypotheses and
          even design novel molecules, but biology remains complex and is
          ultimately a multi-systems discipline. Biology occurs when molecules
          come together, governed by an underlying physics advancing processes
          that occur at disparate spatio-temporal scales, only probed in the wet
          laboratories at different conditions, at different granularities, at
          different levels of fidelity, and incompletely. This workshop poses
          and advances the following question: How can we advance foundation
          models to transform biological research? This workshop brings together
          an interdisciplinary community of researchers at various levels of
          their career to nucleate a community that advances this question.
