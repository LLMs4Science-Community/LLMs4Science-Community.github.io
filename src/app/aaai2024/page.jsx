        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Rapid advances in large language models (LLMs) provide an
          unprecedented opportunity to further scientific inquiry across
          scientific disciplines and domains. Despite remarkable feats in
          natural language tasks often exclusively indicative of human
          intelligence, the potential of LLMs beyond natural language has yet to
          be realized. Outstanding challenges in diverse scientific disciplines,
          such as molecular biology, material science, climate science, geology,
          hydrology, and various domains within them, such as drug discovery,
          quantum material design, weather forecasting, and more, necessitate
          the integration of heterogeneous, multi-modal datasets resulting from
          diverse physical processes, as well as the injection of deep domain
          knowledge accumulated over decades of discovery about the inherent
          processes that govern the natural and biological world. This workshop
          brings together diverse researchers from various disciplines to
          formulate problem spaces, datasets, standards, benchmarks, and spur
          innovation on accessible and inclusive LLMs to power the next
          scientific breakthroughs.

              </p>
              <p>
                Dr. Amarda Shehu is a Professor in the Department of Computer
                Science at George Mason University, where she is also Associate
                Dean of Engineering for AI Innovation and Associate Vice
                President of Research for the Institute of Digital InnovAtion.
                Shehu obtained her Ph.D. from Rice University in 2008, where she
                was also an NIH predoctoral fellow in the Nanobiology Program
                and was dually trained in AI and Molecular Biophysics. Shehu's
                research bridges foundational AI research and AI in support of
                progress across scientific disciplines. Her scholarship includes
                work at the intersection of stochastic optimization, planning,
                deep learning, optimization for deep learning, bioinformatics,
                health informatics, applied NLP, and more. She is a 2022 Fellow
                of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering
                (AIMBE) and is passionate about bridging scientific communities.
                She regularly delivers keynotes and invited talks (IEEE BIBM
                2022, BIOKDD 2021, ICCABS 2020, etc.), organizes tutorials and
                workshops in ACM and IEEE bioinformatics and evolutionary
                computation conferences, and journal collections and special
                issues (PLoS Comput Biol, Curr Opin Struct Biol, Molecules, Intl
                J Mol Sci, etc.) to advance transdisciplinary research. Shehu
                also served as Program Director in the CISE directorate at NSF
                2019-2022 during which time she galvanized various
                sub-communities of CISE, BIO, CHEM, and ENG researchers in
                transdisciplinary research, education programs, and workshops.
                She has extensive expertise bringing together silo-ed
                communities together in workshops (Women @ GECCCO, CSBW, AAAI
                Workshops, etc.), with a strong emphasis on integration and
                leadership for historically-minoritized researchers.{" "}

              </p>
              <p>
                Dr. Yana Bromberg is a Professor in the Departments of Computer
                Science and Biology at Emory University and a Hans Fischer
                Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in the Technical
                University of Munich. She is a noted researcher in computational
                molecular biology. A former NLM Biomedical Informatics doctoral
                student, she is trained in molecular biology and bioinformatics.
                She is known for her work in annotation of genome variant-caused
                functional changes, tracking of microbiome functional shifts due
                to environmental pressures, and exploration of protein
                structures at the origins of life. Her seminal SNAP method, the
                first neural network-based tool for predicting functional
                impacts of single amino acid substitutions has enabled novel
                variant assessment methods and whole genome analyses and methods
                for mapping genetic architectures of disease. Bromberg has
                advanced computational annotation, prediction, and analysis of
                protein functionality, establishing the library of protein folds
                at the origins of life. Her exploration of the microbial world
                has led to advances in understanding molecular functional
                diversity carried out by individual microbes and emergent
                functionality in microbial communities. Bromberg is a director
                of the International Society for Computational Biology and has
                filled a number of leading roles in the organization of ISMB --
                the society's annual flagship conference. She consistently
                delivers keynotes and invited talks at national and
                international conferences (ISMB, GRC, etc.) and lectures at
                relevant workshops and courses (STAMPs workshop @MBL, the
                University of Bologna International Masters Bioinformatics
                program, etc.)
