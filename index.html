        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Rapid advances in large language models (LLMs) provide an unprecedented opportunity to further scientific inquiry across scientific disciplines and domains. Despite remarkable feats in
            natural language tasks often exclusively indicative of human intelligence, the potential of LLMs beyond natural language has yet to be realized. Outstanding challenges in scientific disciplines, such as
            molecular biology, material science, climate science, geology, hydrology, and various domains within
            them, such as drug discovery, quantum material design, weather forecasting, and more, necessitate the
            integration of heterogeneous, multi-modal datasets resulting from diverse physical processes, as well
            as the injection of deep domain knowledge accumulated over decades of discovery about the inherent
            physical processes that govern the natural and biological world. <br/><br/>
            
            <i>Objective:</i> Through this workshop
            we want to bring together diverse communities of researchers for a thoughtful and concerted effort
            at advancing research on LLMs and their integration in learning-enabled frameworks. The hope is
            that by bringing together diverse researchers, we will properly formulate problem spaces and the
            proper datasets, standards, and benchmarks of scientific progress to support and more, excitingly,
            to spur scientific breakthroughs across diverse scientific disciplines and domains. The proposed
            workshop will be an important medium to leverage synergies and facilitate an open exchange of ideas
            so that the research community can advance both foundational research in LLMs, inspired beyond the
            classic NLP tasks and perspectives, as well as science-inspired research on LLM-enabled scientific
            breakthroughs across a variety of scientific disciplines and domains.</p>
